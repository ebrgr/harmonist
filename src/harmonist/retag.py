    release the sidecar no longer names (#65). And the entry is a report of
    something that happened, not of something attempted — a tagging that threw
    part-way should not leave a line claiming the identity moved.

    The alias that keeps the album's pre-merge history reachable is NOT recorded
    here: `sidecar.write()` already records one whenever the canonical id
    changes, and this is one of those. Adding a call would duplicate it at one
    call site while leaving every other identity change relying on the write —
    the shape the event-recording skill warns about.

    Both sinks, because they answer different questions. The activity entry is
    the outcome in the user's language, and the audit line is the pair of ids —
    which is forensics, and doesn't belong in prose the feed renders next to an
    album name it already shows in its own column.

    `label` is passed IN rather than built here, and it is the same string the
    tagging's own entry carries — `tagger.album_label`, off the release this

    choosing it from the mismatch review's candidates and confirming its track
    review already said so, and asking again would be a second confirmation.

    Returns what the tagging actually DID, in its two halves (#482). It used to
    return None, which left `TaggingOutcome.artwork_withheld` with no reader
    anywhere: a re-tag that tagged the album and refused its artwork said only
    "Re-tagged", and the reason reached the user only if they went looking in
    the feed. Callers with nothing to report are free to ignore it.

    `expected_artwork` is the fingerprint of the artwork the album page showed,
    when a page is who asked (#469). A tagging whose plan no longer matches it
    writes the tags and no artwork, and says so in the outcome.

    `artwork_included=False` leaves the artwork half out altogether — what the
    album page's artwork checkbox posts when unticked (#482). Distinct from a
    fingerprint that failed to match: that is a stale preview the user is owed a
    warning about, this is a choice they just made.

    `expected_release` binds confirmation to the stored release shown in its
    review (#532). Apply that snapshot without a request, whatever its age.
    A missing or changed snapshot requires review before any writes. Artwork
    is already cached by the review; do not fetch a different image.

    `scope` is how much of the plan to write, and must agree with the scope
    `expected_artwork` was taken at or the comparison mismatches on every press.
    None keeps the tagger's own derivation, which is what every caller without a
    page in front of it wants.

    `mbid` is what to ask MusicBrainz for, not necessarily what the album ends
    up tagged as: a merged release redirects, and this follows the release it
    actually got (#268). See the rebinding below.

    `incomplete=True` runs the tagger in incomplete mode (file_count <
    MB track count allowed). Nothing is persisted about the count: the tagging
    writes the release's own totals into every file, and that is what the
    scanner derives INCOMPLETE from afterwards (#195).

    `store_url_override` replaces the sidecar's store_url. Used when confirming
    a mis-tag: the album is actually the *owned* edition, so its store_url must
    become the URL where the user purchased it (the candidate's
    `mistag_owned_url`) — otherwise the old (wrong-edition) URL matches no
    purchase and the album can never link, falling through to surrender.
