"""Work the status bar shows while it runs (#757, #786).

A job that works through the library registers a label and its progress here,
and `/status` reports whatever is running, plus the closing line of the last job
to finish. One register rather than a runner, endpoint and status-bar branch per
job: a new bulk job only has to call `job()` to be visible, so the next one is
not forgotten the way the startup update check, the Settings re-check and the
artwork warm-up were.

File writes use the same register with foreground priority and a current file,
so background scans cannot hide the progress of a tag or artwork change.

Not for the routine ten-minute checks. Each tick asks about a handful of albums,
and showing it would flash the bar six times an hour over nothing a person is
waiting for, the noise #349 took out of the log.
