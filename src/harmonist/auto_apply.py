"""Applying the tag updates nobody has to review (#273), and the ones the user
selected in the Inbox (#814), which are written the same way.

The user chooses the highest significance Harmonist may write by itself
(`GardenerConfig.apply_up_to`). This pass writes every waiting update in that
range, and holds back, with a reason, anything that cannot be written with
nobody watching. A held update waits in the Inbox, which is where whatever
auto-tagging could not handle is meant to turn up.

**Written from the stored release.** The verdict an album is judged by comes
from the release in `mb_cache`, so that is what is written, as a reviewed
confirmation writes what its review showed (#532): no MusicBrainz request, and
no chance of writing a newer release than the one judged. Each album is
re-judged against it at write time, because a flag can be older than the
payload beside it.

**Tag writes leave artwork alone.** They pass `artwork_included=False`, so the
artwork store's *no backup, no overwrite* rule has nothing to govern there.

**Artwork is added, never replaced** (#853). The same pass writes the artwork
updates the user trusts Harmonist with, which can only be additions: an image
where a track or the folder has none, so nothing is overwritten and nothing
needs a backup. An album is judged by its whole plan, so one that would also
replace anything waits for a person, additions and all. The plan is rebuilt
from the files at write time, and only its additions are written. The archive's
image comes from the local cache, as on the album page: no request.

**Held updates live in memory**, like the flags they qualify: a tag update keyed
to the MusicBrainz version it was held at, an artwork update to the plan it was
held at. An album is retried when that moves, or after a restart, rather than
on every pass: a failure that recurs every ten minutes is one log line repeated,
not news.
